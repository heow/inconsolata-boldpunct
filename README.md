I've always liked the *Proggy* font, the bold punctuation really makes things stand out especially, especially if you program in Lisp where parens aren't just syntactic sugar, they represent functions and power.

So after getting my mits on the *Inconsolata* font, I did some modifications to create a version with bold punctuation.

It's especially helpful in environments that don't offer syntax coloration.

An example
